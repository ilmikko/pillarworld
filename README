There is no actual gameplay yet. However I am testing different aspects of possible gameplay, including ui elements, animations, world data and rendering, et cetera.
Please keep in mind this is a playground, some things might break as the dependencies change rapidly. If something is broken I probably don't know that it is because I'm too busy developing something else, but just give me a shout out and I'll fix it.

TODO: Add a better readme about the project as a whole
