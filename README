There is no gameplay yet. I'm testing different aspects of gameplay, including ui elements, animations, world data and rendering, et cetera.
Keep in mind this is a playground, some things might break as the dependencies change rapidly, but if it's broken I probably don't know that it is, so just give me a shout out and I'll fix it.

TODO: Add a better readme about the project as a whole
