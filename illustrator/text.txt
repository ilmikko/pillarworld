Lava

Just so that I don't forget
I wanted to test how a lava lake would look like
Where the lava would be made of these vertical loading bar pieces
(so you could see the surface against something)
Like a semi-isometric view
The background color for the bar would be the foreground color for the rest
And background color for the lava because you would have bubbles etc
